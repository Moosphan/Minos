Or, you can ignore the issue with a `tools:ignore=&quot;MissingTranslation&quot;` attribute.&#xA;&#xA;You can tell lint (and other tools) which language is the default language in your `res/values/` folder by specifying `tools:locale=&quot;languageCode&quot;` for the root `&lt;resources>` element in your resource file.
